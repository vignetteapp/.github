# Welcome to Vignette

Vignette is an open source toolkit for livestreamers, made by VTubers, for VTubers. Vignette aims to democratize AI-based tracking without any frills or gotchas, and without any limitations. 

The only limitation is your creativity - and a webcam!

## About the Organization

The organization houses all the related technologies, libraries and the Vignette application itself, along with our community processes and the roadmap. 

Vignette follows a open development model, where anyone can participate in the development itself and contribute their part into the project.
